    <h3>The Importance of the Opportunity Lifecycle</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>What do you predict will be the top sales trend in 2017?</h4>
        <p>Before analytics, AI or machine learning can become the magical, life-changing technology promised, the most delicate and precious data source must be validated: The Opportunity Lifecycle. And the only data source for what happens inside the lifecycle of an opportunity is the salesperson. Once the conversation has begun – once the humans connect – only the salesperson is positioned to capture what happens. The key to understanding customer buying behavior to see it through the eyes of the rep who’s sitting across from the buyer. This is true for all B-to-B sales cycles from transactional to strategic. The analog data collection engine known as the salesperson observes and documents each interaction. The attendees, their role in the decision, the bosses not present, the physical and political requirements to get the deal done. A whirl of variables the salesperson absorbs, translates and calculates when updating each opportunity.</p>
        <p>If sales accurately logs what’s happening, there is tremendous value; but the typical sales mentality is to withhold the truth from the process. When it comes to documenting what’s happening in the opportunity lifecycle, most sales reps operate under that assumption of “how will this be used against me?” So, unfortunately, most sales organizations are great at capturing the misinformation provided by sales, with all of the inherent motivations attached. Because of this, <strong>factored funnels are the “big lie” of sales</strong> and CSOs must tear down that wall in search of the truth. Enterprising CSOs will begin to embrace Opportunity Forensics. Far beyond a won-loss assessment, opportunity forensics goes deep inside the sales cycle to document and codify <strong>how we sell</strong> and <strong>how they buy</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>What impact do you expect this trend to have in the short term? The long term?</h4>
        <p>Pipeline integrity is the final chasm to cross for B-to-B sales. The biggest short-term impact is what happens to the funnel when you start to uncover the truth. When the truth is revealed, there’s going to be a drop in the funnel: 50 percent or more of the sales funnel may disappear overnight. CSOs need to be ready to confront that. What’s left in the funnel: real opportunity and the basis for building up the new way of doing business. In the short term, CSOs must confront this, tear it down and rebuild. They must demonstrate to sales the value of seeking and capturing the truth. One of the strategic capabilities of the Sales Leader is to influence how sales behaves, and this is an important one.</p>
        <p>This is a collision of analog and digital. Before a digital transformation, there must be an analog transformation; unless or until the CSO has confidence of accurately capturing the buyer’s journey, there should be no digital transformation. In the long term, Opportunity Forensics should drive the Digital Transformations that many organizations are undertaking today. There are many digital transformations happening right now in sales - from paper to spreadsheets to digital recording systems. But there must first be this cultural transformation to seek the truth in the opportunity lifecycle. Without that cultural shift, this is merely a transition of tools and not a transformation in process. In the rush to embrace the promise of sales analytics, AI, etc., many organizations are skipping this step.</p>
        <p>Once across the chasm pipeline integrity sales can begin to consider the Digital Transformation path they will all eventually follow.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>What will organizations need to do to take advantage of (or defend against) this trend?</h4>
        <p>CSOs need to confront this head-on. It must be in the strategic capability of Sales Leader to influence how sales behaves - through skills and training, through front-line management, through all of the resources we provide our sellers to prepare them to go out and compete. This should start with a cultural transformation to accurately capture the buyer’s journey through forensic analyst of the opportunity lifecycle. Then a documentation and codification of how we sell and how they buy. Then, and only then, should Sales Leaders entertain a digital transformation to accelerate this.</p>

    <h3>The Science of Sales Becomes Mainstream</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h4>What do you predict will be the top sales trend in 2017?</h4>
        <p>CEOs and board members are demanding more proof from their CSOs that they have built an engine that will deliver results. That engine consists of a winning strategy with the right people, processes and technology to deliver consistent results. We can think of this as a shift to a more scientific approach to sales. It’s no longer enough to “make the number;” CSOs must provide clear evidence that they have complete control of the levers that lead to results.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>What impact do you expect this trend to have in the short term? The long term?</h4>
        <p>The majority of organizations are not ready for this change. In the short term, this is going to cause angst for many CSOs. This is a new dimension of sales leadership, and most CSOs will need to adapt. CSOs are comfortable with productivity outputs: pipeline, quota, forecast and bookings metrics. This will require CSOs to get a handle on productivity inputs. What are the leading indicators of performance? Which metrics need to be isolated to determine what needs more attention and focus? Smaller organizations, particularly in the SaaS space, are very metrics-driven in almost every part of their business, so they are ahead of the curve. While it’s a bigger task, larger organizations can take a cue from emerging companies in this area.</p>
        <p>Some CSOs will adapt by developing these skills for data and process or bring it into their teams. If the Sales Operations function is strong, CSOs can lean on that group to drive this. But it’s more likely that they’ll need to augment the team with talent that can bring a data-driven mindset, understanding of conversion ratios and related processes. Most organizations have under-invested in these skill-sets, which presents an opportunity to elevate the Sales Ops function. When acquiring new talent, CSOs should look for experience in sales as the context for things like process and data that can present a bit of a ramp.</p>
        <p>For the long term, CSOs will look more like the COO. They will be financially literate, more inwardly aware, and will drive both top-line and bottom-line outcomes. They will be able to identify opportunities to be more efficient in making the number. They will also understand the hire-to-retire lifecycle of a sales rep, and will have optimized processes for each step: hiring, onboarding, the sales process, compensation and retention.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4>What will organizations need to do to take advantage of (or defend against) this trend?</h4>
        <p>Sales leaders will need to adapt to the new reality of demonstrating a sustainable revenue engine. They need to take steps to understand productivity metrics and the drivers of performance. They need to understand productivity inputs as well as outputs, and they need to have good leading indicators to identify areas that need work. CSOs will be challenged to narrow their focus and prioritize those areas that will change the trajectory of their organizations. Great sales organizations will be really good at figuring out what to track and prioritize, and smart CSOs will get ahead of this curve and embrace this opportunity to shift to a more scientific approach to sales.</p>
